Collection of coding projects 

# CSCI487MLmodelRNN.ipynb
Coding portion of my computer science senior thesis. Uses a gated recurrent unit recurrent neural network to analyze long non coding RNA (lncRNA) sequences and predicts lncRNA functional role based on its sequence and genomic location. Utilizes functionalities from tensorflow, pytorch, sklearn, numpy, etc.  

# FinalProject.R
Coding portion of my final project for a data visualization class. Uses r packages (i.e. tidyverse, leaflet, dplyr, etc). Analyzes global socioeconomic data and covid-19 related data to illuminate trends of the covid-19 pandemic.

# CSCI444 Final Presentation PDF
